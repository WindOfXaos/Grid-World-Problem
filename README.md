# Grid-World-Problem

# Notes:
* **gridworld.py** is the main file. 
* **ai_search.py** contains **solve()** which gives a solution using one of these search algorithims:
  * Depth First Search
  * Breadth First Search
  * Uniform Cost Search
  * Greedy Search
  * Astar Search
* **test.ipynb** gives more abstracted view of the code using IPython Notebook.
